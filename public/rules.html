                The rules of the Assassin Game are simple. Once the game begins,
                every player will be assigned a target; when they eliminate
                their target, the target of the player they assassinated becomes
                their new target. This continues until there is only one
                assassin remainingâ€”the last living player is the winner.

            <p>
                - Assassinations must happen in a public place, i.e. not on any
                person's property. If your target lives in an apartment or dorm
                room, the actual dorms are off limits but the hallways, lobbies,
                etc. are fair game. If your target lives in a house, the
                sidewalks and streets are fair game but not their porch or
                living room.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Assassinations can typically only be performed with a foam
                dart gun (i.e. Nerf) or water gun. This is sometimes subject to
                the organizer's rules; at conventions, for example, an
                assassination is usually completed by sticking a sticker on your
                target. Please be smart about this; don't use a weapon that will
                hurt your target or one that looks like a real weapon. Don't get
                yourself in trouble... or worse!
            </p>
            <p>
                - There are no teams in the Assassin Game. Keep your target a
                secret from everyone!
